	
Have you ever been to a foreign country?	Yes, I have had the opportunity to live and work in Thailand for almost a year. I was employed by an intergovernmental organization located in a city near Udon Thani, which is situated close to the borders of Laos and Cambodia.
How does your country differ from the one you have visited?	The most noticeable difference between my country and others in the Indochina region, such as Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos, lies in our cultural beliefs. As you may know, the northern regions of my country, in particular, have been heavily influenced by Confucianism from China. We regard this more as a belief system than a religion. On the other hand, countries like Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos have been significantly influenced by Buddhism, which originated from India. This is a stark contrast to Vietnam.
Describe the first  time you used a foreign language to communicate: You should say: What that situation was Where you were then Who you communicated with Explain why you used a foreign language to communicate on that occasion You will have to talk about the topic for 1 to 2 minutes	So this memory really sticks out about the first time I tried using English to actually talk to people when I went to Thailand for a month-long volunteer gig right after finishing high school. I was crazy nervous but pumped for this whole new world outside my comfort zone. Basically, there were ten of us volunteers from all over - France, Mexico, Australia. We were teaming up to create English theater programs for underprivileged Thai schools in more rural areas that didn’t have a lot of resources. Well, I vividly remember totally struggling when we had to present our curriculum plans to the school principals and administrators at orientation. As I was trying to get words out about things like “fostering creative learning” and “building self-confidence”, my brain was on overdrive attempting to translate the ideas that made total sense in Vietnamese so they wouldn’t sound so confusing.  The confusion in the room was obvious and I suddenly really felt for immigrants just struggling to get by in foreign languages. It was discouraging at first when people didn’t get my points and I had to rephrase stuff in, like, three ways. But with my teammates filling in gaps for me, I got there. In the end, it was incredibly rewarding to bring theater to these kids who really ate it up. After pushing through the initial embarrassment, I made up my mind to just chat in English whenever possible. Lo and behold - by week three, it felt natural presenting and writing plays in English! My first attempts stuck with me as motivation to step past those language barriers to connect across cultures.
What do you think of children learning a foreign language?	"I believe exposing children to foreign languages early cultivates fluidity and comfort expressing themselves across cultures. My year-old nephew already recognizes English alphabet just from ABC videos, before even Vietnamese! Their neurological pathways absorb new linguistic patterns so intuitively. Yet true immersion accelerates fluency even for adults."
Do you think is it worth travelling to learn a new language?	Certainly, nothing motivates language acquisition better than navigating foreign environments where reliance becomes essential, like my stint volunteering abroad. Removed from familiar crutches, I adapted more in a month than years reading textbooks. Travel compels conversational practice and retains practical vocabulary much faster by embedding words into tangible contexts and interactions.
What's the best way to learn a foreign language?	From my experience, nothing replaces good old-fashioned practice to build up language patterns in your brain though. Grammar gives you the foundations but doesn't make speech natural. You gotta put in the reps rehearsing everyday polite small talk until reaching smooth narratives about complex stuff. I kick myself thinking how much better my English would be now had I put in dedicated hours way earlier practicing.
Why do some people learn languages faster than others?	"But no doubt, kids immersed early while adults maybe stressed from work and life have a leg up speaking foreign languages without thinking much. I felt that reality trying to explain my volunteer plans to those Thai principals. And yet - the elation I felt putting on our theater production proved consistency conquers language barriers!"
