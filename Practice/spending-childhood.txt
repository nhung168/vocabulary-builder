	
When you go shopping, do you prefer to pay for things in cash or by card? Why?	I particularly use card more often than cash because of its convenience. The main reason is my bad memory to remember withdrawing cash, so I am fond of using smart pay like Apple Pay that is integrated with my banking account on my phone.
Do you ever save money to buy special things? Why/Why not?	Of course. I definitely consider saving when splurging on high-value stuff. For instance, when I bought a tablet, I compared different models comprehensively based on their features to find the one that suited my needs. Then, I had to cut some personal expenses like entertainment and clothes to buy that expensive item.
Would you ever take a job which had low pay? Why/Why not?	When deciding on a job, salary criteria are one of the most important factors I weigh with other criteria. However, I have more tendency to choose a job where I find myself earning learning value rather than money.
Would winning a lot of money make a big difference to your life? Why/Why not?	I am not prepared to get a lot of money by chance, so it will draw me into a state of ambivalence to know how to deal with it. However, I totally agree that it will make a big impact on my life when I am thinking about saving for an apartment.
Describe a toy you liked in your childhood. You should say: What it was, Who gave it to you, What it looked like. Explain why it was a special toy for you. You will have to talk about the topic for 1 to 2 minutes.	When I think of my childhood, one toy that stands out in my memory is a teddy bear. It was a gift from my parents when I turned five years old, and I had been yearning for it for a long time. The teddy bear was giant, fluffy, and brown with a big body that I couldn’t hug all over with my own arms. I remember feeling so happy and excited when I first saw it.<br><br>The most adorable thing about the teddy bear was its two big, black pupils. Looking into its eyes soothed me and gave me a sense of compassion. I could talk to it the whole day about my daily life when I had to stay home alone and didn’t have many friends. I also played with it by doing house chores, cooking, laundry, or making DIY clothes for it. I considered it my closest friend in my childhood, and I maintained our friendship until I grew up.<br><br>I remember how the teddy bear catered to my compassionate, patient, and warm-hearted personality, which I learned from it. It was always there for me when I needed someone to talk to, and it never judged me. I felt like I could tell it anything, and it would listen. Even though I’m an adult now, I still have the teddy bear, and it still holds a special place in my heart.
Do you think toys really help in children’s development?	Yes, I do think toys play an important role in children’s development. One reason is that toys can stimulate children’s curiosity, creativity, and problem-solving skills, which are essential for learning and innovation. For instance, when children play with building blocks, puzzles, or Lego, they have to use their imagination and logic to create something new and overcome challenges.
Does modern technology have an influence on children’s toys?	Yes, I think modern technology has a significant influence on children’s toys. One reason is that technology has enabled the creation of more interactive, immersive, and educational toys that can offer different experiences and benefits to children. For example, there are toys that use augmented reality, virtual reality, or artificial intelligence to make the play more realistic, engaging, and fun. There are also toys that can help children learn new skills, such as coding, robotics, or music.
In general, do children today have many toys?	I think it depends on the situation and the preference of each child and their family. One reason is that some children may have many toys, while others may have few or none, depending on their economic and social circumstances, their access to resources, and their culture. For example, some children in developed countries may have access to a wide range of toys, from traditional to technological, while some children in developing countries may have to make do with whatever they can find or create. Another reason is that some children may prefer to play with a variety of toys, while others may stick to one or a few favorites, depending on their personality, interests, and needs. For instance, some children may enjoy exploring different types of toys and games, while others may be more attached to a specific toy or game that they find comforting or challenging.
How do you think toys will change in the future?	I think toys will change in the future in many ways. One way is that toys will become more sustainable, meaning that they will use less plastic and more eco-friendly materials, and that they will have longer lifespans and be easier to recycle or reuse. For example, there are already some initiatives to create biodegradable or compostable toys, or to collect and transform old toys into new ones. Another way is that toys will become more personalized, meaning that they will adapt to the preferences, abilities, and goals of each child, and that they will offer more options for customization and creativity. For instance, there are already some toys that use artificial intelligence to learn from the child’s behavior and feedback, or that allow the child to design their own characters, stories, or games. A third way is that toys will become more connected, meaning that they will use the internet, cloud, or blockchain to communicate with other toys, devices, or people, and that they will offer more opportunities for collaboration and socialization. For example, there are already some toys that use augmented reality or virtual reality to create shared virtual environments, or that use blockchain to create secure and transparent digital assets or transactions.
