	
Are you happy to be the age you are now? Why or why not?	 I find myself in a state of ambivalence about my current age due to various external pressures. At this stage in my life, my parents are encouraging me to get married, especially since many of my friends have already settled down. This has led to a feeling of being left behind, as I grapple with other personal concerns beyond just getting married.
When you were a child, did you think a lot about your future? Why/Why not?	Absolutely. I believe that not just me, but most children are inherently curious about their future. I found myself asking countless questions about who I would become, what profession I would choose, and who I would end up marrying.
Do you think you have changed as you have got older? Why/Why not?	Definitely. I’ve noticed a significant difference between the person I am today and the person I had envisioned myself to be. I’ve come to realize that life is like a box of chocolates - you never know what you’re going to get.
What will be different about your life in the future? Why?	 While I can’t predict the future with certainty, I do have some plans. One of them is to study abroad, which I believe will open a new chapter in my life. I’m considering a change in my career pathway, with a focus on delving deeper into academia.
Describe a time when you started using a new technological device. You should say: What device you started using, why you started using this device, how easy or difficult it was to use	I’d like to talk about the time when I started using my first personal laptop, a MacBook, which marked a significant shift in my technological journey. This transition occurred when I left my first job, where I had been provided with several computers that didn’t quite meet my satisfaction.The decision to choose a MacBook was not made in isolation. I consulted with a few friends who were well-versed in technology. Their insights and experiences with Apple’s products convinced me to give it a try, despite my familiarity with Microsoft’s Windows operating system.The initial phase of using the MacBook was quite challenging. The operating system was entirely different from Windows, which I had been using for years. I had to familiarize myself with the new interface, learn how to install applications, and understand the system requirements for various software. It was a steep learning curve, but I was determined to master it.Despite the initial struggles, I was immensely satisfied with my MacBook. The processing speed was remarkably fast, and the pre-installed licensed software made it easier to get started. One feature that stood out was the trackpad’s gesture control, which offered a level of convenience and efficiency that I hadn’t experienced before. In retrospect, starting to use the MacBook was a challenging yet rewarding experience. It broadened my technological horizons and enhanced my computing experience significantly. Despite the initial hurdles, I am glad I made the switch and have been a satisfied MacBook user ever since.
What is the best age for children to start computer lessons?	I believe that the best age for children to start computer lessons is when they start formal schooling, around the age of 6 or 7. At this age, children have developed enough cognitive skills to understand basic instructions and can start learning about technology in a fun, educational way.
Do you think that schools should use more technology to help children to learn?	Yes, I do. Technology, when used appropriately, can greatly enhance the learning experience. It can make lessons more interactive, provide access to a wealth of information, and prepare students for a future where digital literacy is crucial. However, it’s important to balance the use of technology with traditional teaching methods to ensure a well-rounded education.
Do you agree or disagree that computers will replace teachers one day?	I disagree with the notion that computers will replace teachers. While technology can aid in the learning process, it cannot replicate the human interaction, empathy, and personal touch that teachers provide. Teachers play a crucial role in motivating students, understanding their individual needs, and shaping their character, which computers cannot do.
