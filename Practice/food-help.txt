	
What sorts of food do you like eating most? Why?	I have a particular fondness for street foods. They delicately represent the unique cultures of each country. Whenever I travel, I make it a point to try different foods to better understand the local culture.
Who normally does the cooking in your home? Why?	The responsibility of cooking in my home usually depends on who has the time. More often than not, my mom takes charge of the kitchen as she is keen on ensuring the quality of our food intake for health reasons, which helps us avoid junk food.
Do you watch cookery programmes on TV? Why/Why not?	I thoroughly enjoy watching reality cooking shows on TV, especially Master Chef. I find it fascinating to observe how they prepare various dishes using diverse culinary techniques from different cultures.
In general, do you prefer eating out or eating at home? Why?	While I appreciate both, if I had to choose, I would opt for eating at home. This preference stems from a period when I didn’t have time to cook and had to eat out, which led to digestive issues. I realized that these issues were likely due to the hygiene and quality of the food ingredients I was consuming. Despite the allure of delicious food outside, I now prefer to eat at home.
Describe a situation or a time you helped someone. You should say: Who you helped and why, How you helped this person, What the result was. Explain how you felt about helping this person	I recall a time when I was tasked with assisting in the establishment of an agricultural cooperative in a mountainous region. The manager of the cooperative, who seemed quite nervous when I first met him, was struggling with the challenges of starting from scratch, with no budget for running the business. My plan was to help them create a nursery for planting rattan, a non-timber product that is now rarely grown in natural forests.<br><br>The manager was unsure of how to begin or how to mobilize resources from his members, most of whom had below-average incomes and aspired merely to earn enough for food and other necessities. The first thing I did was to help him reorganize his thoughts by creating an Excel sheet to manage activities more functionally. I advised him on how to persuade his members to engage in other ways. Instead of using tangible physical assets, we encouraged people to contribute other resources, such as their time or their land, free of charge.<br><br>He came up with some agreements for their contributions, promising to return a portion of the profit to them annually. Eventually, the nursery was completed, thanks to enormous efforts and keeping to our promises. Although I haven’t visited that place for a long time, I’ve heard that the manager has become more successful with the cooperative nursery, generating more income for the community in that area.<br><br>Helping this cooperative was a rewarding experience for me. It was fulfilling to see how my assistance could make a significant difference in the lives of the community members and contribute to the success of the cooperative. It reinforced my belief in the power of cooperation and community engagement. I felt proud and satisfied knowing that my efforts had a positive impact.
Do you think it’s important to help people?	Yes, I believe it’s crucial to help others. Helping people not only benefits those who receive help but also fosters a sense of community and mutual respect. It can create a positive environment where everyone feels valued and supported.
How can we encourage children to help others?	We can encourage children to help others by setting a good example. Children often emulate the behavior they see around them. So, if they see adults helping others, they are likely to do the same. Additionally, we can teach them about empathy and the importance of understanding and addressing the needs of others.
Do you like helping others?	Certainly, I used to work in non-profit organization where I mostly supported different people. As you remember, I primarily support community development in my case for rattan cooperative manager, I also need to assist my colleague to fulfill some tasks like refining their proposals, reporting or assessing information 
How can charitable organizations help people?	Charitable organizations play a vital role in society by providing assistance to those in need. They can offer a range of services, from providing food and shelter to the homeless, to funding research for medical conditions. Moreover, they raise awareness about various social issues and advocate for change.
