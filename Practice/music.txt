Have you ever learned to play a musical instrument? Which one?	I attempted learning the organ as a child from my sister but gave up after a couple years without ongoing practice. My knowledge faded, though I wish to try again one day as a nostalgic hobby.
Do you think children shoul learn to play a musical instrument at school? Why or Why not?	Yes, music education even through basic recorder or percussion nourishes neurological development and self-expression in children. Schools should integrate creative arts like instruments to cultivate brain pathways.
How easy would it be to learn to play a instrument without a teacher? Why?	Mastering instruments independently has become more viable with smartphone tutorial apps that diagnose tone accuracy and provide feedback.

Describe an event that you've recently attended and enjoyed. You should say What the purpose of the event was, Who you attended the event with, What was unique or enjoyable about the event and describe how you enjoyed it	I'm so excited to share with you my experience of attending the MJ Musical show last week. It was one of the most amazing events I've ever been to and I enjoyed every minute of it. The MJ Musical show was a special tribute to the legendary Michael Jackson, who would have turned 100 years old this year. The show celebrated his incredible contribution to the music industry and his lasting influence on generations of artists and fans. The show featured some of the best performers from around the world, who sang and danced to some of his most iconic songs.I was lucky enough to get a ticket to the show when I came to the US this fall. I went with my friend who is also a huge fan of Michael Jackson. We were both so thrilled to be part of this historic event and to see some of our favorite celebrities in person. We even got to take some selfies with them!The show was unique and enjoyable in so many ways. First of all, the stage design was spectacular. It was like being transported to different eras and places that were inspired by Michael Jackson's music videos. There were pyrotechnics, lasers, holograms, and even a giant moonwalk! The costumes and props were also amazing and matched the themes of each song.Secondly, the performances were phenomenal. The singers and dancers were so talented and energetic. They captured the essence and spirit of Michael Jackson's style and personality. They also interacted with the audience and made us feel like we were part of the show. Some of the highlights for me were Thriller, Smooth Criminal, Billie Jean, and Man in the Mirror.Thirdly, the show was exclusive and special because it included some soundtracks that the crew never performed before. These were songs that Michael Jackson had written or recorded but never released to the public. They were like hidden gems that we got to discover for the first time. They were beautiful and touching and showed a different side of Michael Jackson's genius.I enjoyed the show immensely and felt so inspired and moved by it. It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to celebrate the life and legacy of one of the greatest artists of all time.
What kinds of parties do people usually have in your country	In Vietnam, small parties bring coworkers or friends together for chill celebrations of random special days or achievements. At the nonprofit I worked at, we’d raise glasses at a pub for stuff like World Wildlife Day or getting a project grant - just excuses to bond and take a quick break!
Why are parties important?	Culturally for us, big extended family gatherings at lunar new year or ancestors' death anniversaries are hugely sacred. These massive reunions with dozens of cousins, aunts and uncles crowded together to feast, play music and sing karaoke are when we honor family history.
Do you think parties will become more popular in the future?	But I doubt in-person parties will keep their central role with technology enabling remote hangouts. My gen already uses Facebook and Zoom more for quick meetups with pals across cities or who moved abroad. Why spend hours commuting for short catch-ups when you can video chat often guilt-free? I’ll still show my elders respect at traditional family occasions but digital hangouts are my regular go-to.
