Describe a hotel where you  have recently stayed. You should say: Why you stay there, Where it was located, How it looked. Explain what you liked about the hotel	I recently had the pleasure of staying at a villa in Hoi An, an ancient town located in Central Vietnam. The villa is owned by a former colleague of mine who graciously invited me to spend a night there.  The villa captivated me with its pure beauty and elegant decoration, reminiscent of my traditional ancestral home. Nestled within a stunning agricultural farm, the villa offers a refreshing atmosphere and a sense of authenticity that provides a retreat from the hustle and bustle of urban life.  The houses are adorned with lovely blooming flowers and botanical gardens, adding to the charm of the place. The designer incorporated some subtle elements, such as allowing an old tree to grow inside the house and using it to create a green roof, which I found particularly delightful.  What I loved most about the villa was not just its design, but also the warmth of the people there. They welcomed me with smiling faces, making me feel at home. Their attention to even the smallest details made my stay truly memorable.  In conclusion, the villa in Hoi An provided a unique and enjoyable experience, combining traditional aesthetics with modern comforts and exceptional hospitality.
What kinds of hotels do travellers in your country prefer?	Travellers’ preferences vary based on their nationalities, from my observation. Asian tourists tend to prefer modest hotels with convenient locations for recreational activities and diverse food options. In contrast, Western travellers often seek quieter places where they can retreat from crowded and bustling areas.
What will you pay attention to when you choose a hotel room?	I am particularly drawn to rooms with stunning views where I can enjoy scenic landscapes and sunbathe most of the time. I also pay attention to the facilities provided in the room. As I often travel with compact luggage that doesn’t include some necessities like a hairdryer or iron, I expect these essential items to be provided by the hotel.
Is the hotel industry developed in your country?	Definitely, I believe that my country offers numerous optimistic opportunities for tourism development. With its burgeoning appealing landscapes like long beaches, blue oceans, rich biodiversity, and especially the most adventurous caves, my nation is a treasure trove. However, we have yet to fully explore all of its advantages and need more investment in infrastructure and skill development for hospitality services.
What are the challenges of working in the hospitality business?	The most significant challenge in hospitality services is ensuring customer satisfaction. Catering to the diverse tastes and preferences of various types of customers can be a conundrum. Additionally, not all staff are trained with the necessary professional skills to handle all customer-related matters, leading to occasional dissatisfaction. This can result in low ratings for their services, which could adversely affect their reviews. Potential guests might cancel their bookings if they read harsh comments about the quality or services. It’s akin to the soft power of customers that every hospitality service must be mindful of.
