	
Where is your home?	My home is situated about 40 kilometers outside the city, in a suburban area.
Do you live in a house or a flat?	I reside in a quaint cottage that’s surrounded by a lush garden, which my parents lovingly tend to. Our garden even boasts a longan tree that’s over 70 years old.
Who do you live with?	I share my home with my parents, who are somewhat elderly and occasionally require assistance.
Are there many rooms in your home?	Our two-storey cottage comprises a living room, a kitchen, and four bedrooms.
What is your favorite room?	While I appreciate the entire house and its surrounding greenery, if I had to pick a favorite spot, it would be the balcony adjacent to my bedroom. It’s my preferred spot for reading books and enjoying the fresh air.
How are the walls decorated?	The walls of our house are relatively unadorned. My parents have a fondness for plants and flowers, so they often adorn the walls with orchid plants that bloom beautifully in the spring.
What would you change about your home?	Given the opportunity, I would invest in new furniture and smart home devices. As my parents are aging and I’m often busy, I believe these devices could help simplify their daily routines.
Do you plan to live there in the future?	Absolutely. I have a deep affection for my home and plan to make it even more comfortable in the future.
What facilities are there near your home?	Due to our home’s location on the outskirts of the city, nearby facilities are somewhat limited. However, a new supermarket recently opened, and there are a few cafés and snack bars near the local school.
What is your neighborhood like?	Our neighborhood resembles a small, traditional village, characteristic of Northern rural areas in Vietnam. It features a large pond and a central temple, which serves as a gathering place for meetings and festive events.
Do most people live in houses in your country?	In Hanoi, rapid urbanization and high population density have led to a shift from houses to condos and apartment buildings, which are becoming increasingly popular among residents.
