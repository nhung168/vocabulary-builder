	
Are your friends mostly your age or different ages? Why?	I have friends of various ages. I value the wisdom and life lessons I can learn from my older friends, while I find it easy to share common interests and experiences with those my own age.
Do you usually see your friends during the week or weekends? Why?	I usually meet my friends on weekends. This is primarily because my weekdays are typically occupied with work, often extending into late hours. On weekends, however, I have more leisure time, which I enjoy spending at a café, catching up with my friends about our lives.
The last time you saw your friend, what did you do together?	The last time I saw my friend was last weekend when we celebrated the end of the year. As we both share a passion for food, we often seize any opportunity to try new dishes. On this occasion, we indulged in some delectable street food.
In what ways are your friends important to you?	What I value most in my friendships is mutual understanding. I have maintained close bonds with some friends for years because we can freely exchange our thoughts without any hesitation. This open communication has been the foundation of our enduring friendships, rather than the quantity of relationships.
Describe a thing you bought, that you had to save money for. You should say: What it was, how long it took you to save money for it. What you felt when you bought it. Explain why you wanted to buy it.	The item I’d like to discuss is my most recent purchase, a tablet. This wasn’t an impulsive buy. In fact, it was a carefully considered decision. You see, I already owned a personal laptop that served various purposes. It was my companion for work, entertainment, and sometimes, my late-night research endeavours. However, when I embarked on a new journey with a part-time job, my needs changed. This job required me to read and review numerous documents, a task that was proving to be quite challenging on my laptop.<br>That’s when I started contemplating the idea of buying a tablet. I spent countless hours researching various models, comparing their features, and reading user reviews. After much deliberation, I decided on a Samsung tablet. It was a perfect blend of power and portability, with features that catered exactly to my requirements.<br> But buying this tablet was not easy. It was quite expensive, equivalent to almost two months’ worth of my salary. To afford it, I had to make some sacrifices. I cut back on non-essential expenses such as dining out and entertainment. I even limited my social outings with friends. It was a tough period, but the thought of owning the tablet kept me motivated.<br>Finally, the day arrived when I had saved enough to buy the tablet. I remember feeling a mix of excitement and relief as I made the purchase. It was a moment of triumph, a testament to my patience and perseverance.<br>Now, I can confidently say that the purchase was truly worthwhile. The tablet has not only made my work more comfortable but also added convenience to my life. I no longer have to spend the entire day confined to my office chair. I can take the tablet anywhere, like a café, and work at ease.
<br> Moreover, the tablet has been a boon for my IELTS preparation. Instead of buying printed books, I can use digital books for note-taking and practical exercises. This has made my study sessions more efficient and environmentally friendly.<br>In conclusion, I am extremely satisfied with my tablet. It has proven to be a helpful tool in ways I hadn’t anticipated. It was a purchase that required sacrifice and patience, but in the end, it was all worth it.
