	
Have you ever been in very cold weather? When?	Yes, I experienced extremely cold weather five years ago in Switzerland during the winter season. The temperature often fell below 5°C, and at times, it was even subzero.
How often is the weather cold in your area?	I reside in Hanoi, a city in Northern Vietnam. The climate here becomes notably colder from October to February due to the monsoon winds originating from China. In recent years, this chilly period has extended until April due to climate changes.
Are some parts of your country colder than others? Why?	Absolutely, Northern Vietnam experiences significantly colder temperatures compared to the Central and Southern regions of the country. These latter areas typically have two seasons - dry and rainy - with average temperatures around 20°C. In contrast, temperatures in the North can plunge below 9°C due to geographical and climatic variations.
Would you prefer to live in a hot place or a cold place? Why?	I would choose a hotter climate because I have health issues related to cold weather allergies that cause frequent sneezing during colder periods.
Describe a subject you did not like when you were at school but which you find interesting now. You should say: What subject it was, how much time you  spent learning it, why you did not like it at school. Explain why you find this subject interesting now	"The subject that I initially found uninteresting during my school years was Computer Science. This was primarily due to the curriculum at my high school, which was quite outdated at the time. We were taught old programming languages, such as MS-DOS, which seemed irrelevant and out-of-touch with the rapidly evolving tech world. The tasks assigned were often complex and felt mundane. For instance, we were required to use command prompts to move files from one folder to another. This was a process I found particularly tedious and unengaging. Moreover, Computer Science was not a compulsory subject in our curriculum. This gave me the leeway to often rely on my friends to help with the exercises instead of investing time and effort to understand and complete them myself. I viewed the subject as a burdensome chore rather than an opportunity to learn something new and exciting. However, as I embarked on my professional journey, my perspective on this subject underwent a significant transformation. In my current job, I found that having a strong command over various computer skills was not just beneficial, but essential. I was required to use office applications for a multitude of tasks, such as data processing and preparing presentations. This necessity compelled me to delve deeper into the subject. As I began to explore Computer Science more thoroughly, I realized its immense relevance and importance in today's digital age. I discovered that understanding how different software applications work and how they can be used to simplify tasks and increase productivity was not just useful, but also quite fascinating. This newfound interest sparked a curiosity in me that I had not experienced during my school years. Now, I find myself eager to learn more about the latest developments in the field of Computer Science. I enjoy understanding the intricacies of different programming languages and the logic behind various software applications. The subject that I once viewed as a tedious obligation has now become a captivating area of interest for me. In retrospect, I believe that my initial disinterest in Computer Science was largely due to the way it was taught during my school years. If the curriculum had been more up-to-date and the teaching methods more engaging, I might have developed an interest in the subject much earlier. Nevertheless, I am glad that I have now discovered the fascinating world of Computer Science and look forward to continuing my learning journey in this field."
What school subjects do you think are the most important ones?	I believe that the importance of school subjects can vary depending on the individual’s interests and career goals. However, generally speaking, core subjects like Mathematics, Science, and Language Arts are considered crucial as they provide foundational skills and knowledge that are applicable in various fields.
What subjects will be the most important ones in the future?	With the rapid advancement of technology and the increasing importance of sustainable practices, I foresee subjects like Computer Science, Environmental Science, and Robotics gaining more prominence in the future. These subjects equip students with the skills and knowledge to navigate and contribute to the evolving digital and environmental landscape.
What subjects should be optional and which one should be compulsory?	Optional subjects could include those that cater to specific interests and talents, such as Art, Music, or Physical Education. On the other hand, core subjects like Mathematics, Science, and Language Arts should remain compulsory to ensure that all students acquire basic competency in these areas, regardless of their future paths.
Do you think it would be a good idea to let high school students choose the subjects they study?	I believe it could be beneficial to allow high school students some choice in their curriculum. This could foster a sense of ownership over their learning and enable them to explore their interests and talents. However, it’s also important to ensure that they complete core foundational courses to equip them with essential skills and knowledge.
