	
Are you working or studying? 	 I am currently both working and studying. I work as an independent researcher, which requires me to self-study various subjects that my projects cover.
What is your job/study? 	 My research is focused on socioeconomic issues like carbon markets, forest management, and equity.
Where do you work/study? 	 As a remote worker, I usually work from home with my office based in London. However, I occasionally prefer to work from caf√© workspaces where I can interact with others conducting similar research.
Is this a popular job/field of study in your country? 	 I don't believe many people are familiar with the non-profit development projects I work on. The specific industries I research seem obscure to the general public in my country.
Do you like your job/study? 	 Yes, I enjoy the autonomous nature of my work compared to a nine-to-five job with strict schedules and rules that I find mentally draining. I like managing my own projects.
Do you get on well with your colleagues? 	 Absolutely. Despite timezone differences, we communicate remotely often about our common research interests. Finding like-minded connections makes work interactions engaging for me.
What was your first day like? 	 I'll admit I was nervous at first about my English abilities and whether my colleagues would understand me. However, they were kind and patient in resolving any confusion, which put me at ease.
What responsibilities do you have at work? 	 I am responsible for conducting literature reviews of various global issues. For example, for a current project on migration, I am reviewing research on the root causes behind irregular migration worldwide.
If you had the chance, would you change your job? 	 Yes, I would like to specialize in higher level research within my field over time. I intend to continue developing my expertise, potentially in the same organization.
Do you plan to continue with your job in the future? 	 Absolutely. I am passionate about my research work and wish to sustain this career long-term.
