What kind of things give status to people in your country?	In my country, social status is often associated with material possessions. People are assessed based on their clothes, assets, and belongings. However, I also believe that intangible qualities, such as knowledge and experience, play a significant role in defining a person’s status. These insights take time to observe and appreciate.
Have things changed since your parents’ time?	Absolutely! There have been remarkable changes compared to the past when the older generation lived. These changes primarily stem from rapid technological advancements over the decades. For instance, older generations were familiar with traditional communication methods like fax or letters, while the younger generation now has easy access to various forms of communication, bridging the gap that older generations faced.
Do you think advertising influences what people buy?	Without a doubt, advertising plays a crucial role in shaping customer behavior. When making purchasing decisions, we often lean toward brands that we recognize due to the images or melodies imprinted on our brains by advertisements. This mental process subtly alters our decision-making. However, as a customer, I’ve learned to pause and compare features more carefully before making a choice.
