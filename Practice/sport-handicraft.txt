	
Do you like watching sport? Why?	I’m not particularly fond of sports. This probably stems from my high school days when I struggled with various sports exercises. While others seemed to excel at activities like running, badminton, and jumping, I found them quite challenging.
What is the most popular sport in your country? Why?	While our nation has several signature sports like table tennis and traditional martial arts, I believe football is the most popular sport in my country. This is largely due to our national football team’s recent successes against some of the world’s top teams
How often do you do sport? Why?	I don’t frequently engage in sports, as you might have guessed. However, I understand the health benefits of physical activity, even if I’m not particularly skilled. Occasionally, especially on weekends, I enjoy sketching exercises, yoga, or swimming, activities I feel I’m reasonably good at.
Would you like to take up a new sport in the future? Why?	I’m considering taking up dance sport. I had the opportunity to try it during my university years and found it quite enjoyable. It’s not just about mastering the movements; I also learned a lot about rhythm and melody in music.
Describe an art or craft activity eg painting, wood work that you made at school. You should say: What you made, How you made it, What it look like, How you felt about the activity	In honor of Teacher’s Day, my classmates and I decided to create the biggest handmade card our school had ever seen. We wanted to express our admiration and love for our teachers, and we thought a grand gesture like this would be the perfect way to do so.    The process of making the card was a collaborative effort. We divided ourselves into teams, each responsible for a different aspect of the card. Some of us were in charge of the drawing and painting, creating beautiful illustrations of our school and the memorable moments we had shared with our teachers. Others were tasked with writing heartfelt messages, expressing our gratitude and respect for our teachers. We also included photos and sticky notes, adding a personal touch to the card.    The card was enormous, almost the size of a blackboard. It was filled with vibrant colors from our drawings and paintings, and the photos and sticky notes added a unique texture to it. The messages were written in elegant handwriting, making the card look even more special.    As for how I felt about the activity, I must say it was one of the most fulfilling experiences I’ve had. Not only did it allow me to tap into my creative side, but it also strengthened the bond between my classmates and me. We worked together, laughed together, and in the end, created something truly beautiful. The look of surprise and joy on our teachers’ faces when we presented the card to them was priceless. It was a clear reminder of why we had put so much effort into this activity. It wasn’t just about creating an art piece; it was about showing our appreciation for our teachers, who had given us so much
Do people in your country send handicrafts as gifts?	Yes, it’s quite common in my country for people to gift handmade items, especially among high school friends. I recall receiving a unique gift from a friend - an origami heart made from dozens of small pieces of paper. I’ve kept it to this day as it’s a vivid reminder of our friendship
What do young people think of traditional handicrafts?	 “Young people, like myself, often view traditional handicrafts as symbols of affection. This is particularly true among girls who often use these crafts to express their feelings towards someone. While boys might have a different perspective, I still remember the beautiful memories from high school when girls would show their affection by giving small handicraft presents to the boys they liked.”
What are the benefit of doing handicrafts?	 “Handicrafts offer numerous benefits. They’re not just about expressing affection towards someone, but also about developing skills. For instance, I remember spending an entire day in high school baking cookies as a birthday present for my friend. The compliments I received for those cookies motivated me to improve my baking skills.”
