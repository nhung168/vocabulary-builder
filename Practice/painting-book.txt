Describe a book you have recently read. You should say: What the book was about, when you read it, why you decided to read it	So, I stumbled upon this amazing book called ‘Poor Economics’ while doing some research for work at the library. It’s written by these Nobel Prize-winning economists, and it’s all about poverty and development work around the world.<br><br>One story that really stuck with me was about a deworming program in an African country. The authors explained how it not only improved health outcomes but also had a big impact on children’s education. This gave me a different perspective on project effectiveness - it’s not just about the direct effects, but also the indirect benefits that might not be as tangible.<br><br>As someone who’s been working in various development programs for years, this book helped me understand the fundamental cause-and-effect relationships that I’ve been trying to grasp. It inspired me to think critically and develop new concepts for my work.<br><br>You see, my job as a monitoring evaluation officer for a non-profit NGO involves measuring the effectiveness of projects like ecosystem payments for forestry communities or timber production value chains. Reading ‘Poor Economics’ gave me a lot of insights and unexpectedly answered many of my questions.
Why are e-books so popular nowadays?	I think the popularity of e-books can be attributed to the rapid advancement of technology. In today’s fast-paced world, people prefer to have information at their fingertips. E-books cater to this need by providing instant access to a wealth of knowledge. The convenience of being able to search for specific information within an e-book, rather than manually flipping through pages of a physical book, is another factor contributing to their popularity.
What are the disadvantages of paper books?	One of the main disadvantages of paper books, in my opinion, is their lack of portability. If you’re an avid reader like me, you’d understand the struggle of wanting to carry multiple books while travelling. It’s simply not feasible, especially if the books are heavy. This is where digital books come in handy. With a Kindle, for instance, you can have access to a multitude of books without the burden of their physical weight.
Do you think that people are reading less than in the past?	I don’t necessarily believe that people are reading less than in the past. Rather, I think the medium through which people read has changed. In the past, you could easily spot people reading newspapers or books in public spaces. Nowadays, people are more likely to read on digital devices, which might give the impression that they’re not reading at all.
Will paper books and libraries disappear in the nearest future?	Observing the current trends, it seems quite likely that paper books and traditional libraries might become obsolete in the near future. Many libraries are already transitioning towards digital platforms, making it easier for people to access their vast repositories of knowledge. Old books are being digitized, and technologies like image-to-text conversion are making the process faster than ever.
