Describe your favourite photograph. You should say: where the photo was taken, who took the photo, what can be seen in the photo. Explain why it is your favourite photograph	My favourite photograph is a truly captivating image that encapsulates the raw beauty and diversity of the wetlands along the Mississippi River. This photograph was taken by a conservation scholar from Tulane University, a renowned institution known for its commitment to environmental research and conservation.  I first encountered this photograph during my visit to New Orleans in the fall. I was there as a visiting fellow, conducting research on the effects of climate change on the Mississippi River. The photograph was displayed in the university library office, a place teeming with knowledge and insights from various scholars.  The photograph is a stunning representation of the burgeoning biodiversity in the wetlands. It captures a moment of pure serenity and life - a dolphin gracefully leaping out of the water, its body glistening under the sun. In another corner of the photograph, you can see a flock of birds migrating, their formation creating a beautiful pattern against the clear blue sky.  The photograph also showcases an oyster reef, a critical component of the wetland ecosystem. Oyster reefs provide a habitat for a variety of marine life and play a crucial role in water filtration. The sight of the oyster reef in the photograph serves as a reminder of the intricate and delicate balance of nature.  However, the photograph doesn’t shy away from the harsh realities. It depicts the stark reality of land loss with houses shrinking in the background. This is a direct consequence of climate change and a pressing issue that my research aims to address.  What makes this photograph my favourite is not just the vivid imagery it presents, but also the story it tells. It serves as a stark reminder of the beauty of nature and the impact of climate change. It’s a testament to the resilience of life in the face of adversity and a call to action for conservation efforts.  Every time I look at it, I am filled with a sense of awe for the beauty of nature, a sense of urgency for the need to address climate change, and a renewed commitment to my research. It reminds me of why I chose to embark on this path of research and reinforces my determination to contribute to the preservation of our environment.  In conclusion, this photograph is more than just a picture to me. It’s a source of inspiration, a symbol of hope, and a constant reminder of the role each one of us plays in preserving our planet.
