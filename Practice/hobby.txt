How do you spend your holidays	During holidays, I prefer to retreat into nature with my family or friends. We often plan hiking or camping trips to places like national parks. The fresh air and scenic views serve as a rejuvenating experience, helping to restore my energy.

Describe an experience when you were disappointed: When it was, What exactly happened, why it was disappointing you	When I was 12 years old, a significant transition period from primary to secondary level, my parents enforced strict rules to ensure I focused on my studies. Like any child, I was drawn to the limited entertainment options available, particularly television. I could spend the entire day engrossed in TV shows, which understandably concerned my parents. One day, a popular movie called ‘The Matrix’, featuring Keanu Reeves, was scheduled to air on television. The buzz around this movie was immense, and I was eagerly looking forward to it. However, to my disappointment, our family TV broke down, and my parents decided not to repair it. I was devastated and pleaded with them to fix it, as I didn’t want to miss out on watching this much-talked-about movie. Despite my pleas, they didn’t relent, and I ended up missing the movie. The following day, all I could hear were my friends raving about the fascinating scenes and actions in the movie. Even now, I haven’t watched ‘The Matrix’ because it reminds me of that disappointing experience.
Do you think people nowadays get disappointed easily?	Certainly, disappointment varies across generations. The older generation, having faced numerous difficulties, tends to accept unexpected events more easily. On the other hand, the younger generation, despite having ample resources, often struggles to cope with adversities. Furthermore, with the increasing pressures of modern life, people are dealing with various mental issues like depression and peer pressure, leading to more frequent disappointments.
Do you often get disappointed with things?	I am the kind of person who gets disappointed easily. This primarily stems from the high standards I set for myself. I often question my actions and repeatedly crosscheck my work until I am satisfied. However, if the results do not match my efforts, I tend to feel disappointed immediately.
Why do you think people get disappointed?	The main cause of disappointment often stems from our specific cultural and societal contexts. For instance, in Vietnamese culture, economic status is a significant factor in societal evaluation. People are often classified based on their wealth, leading to a relentless pursuit of materialistic achievements. If they fail to attain these societal standards, they, along with their families, feel disappointed.
Do you think it’s important to have expectations?	Having personal expectations is essential as it provides us with goals in life. However, if these expectations are based on extrinsic motivations rather than intrinsic ones, they can be fleeting and unfulfilling. It’s important that our aspirations align with our core desires such as well-being and self-compassion, rather than being solely focused on external validations.
